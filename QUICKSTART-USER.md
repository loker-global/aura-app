## 🎯 What AURA Does

AURA turns your voice into a living, breathing visual presence.  
Not a waveform. Not a spectrogram. A **calm, embodied orb**.

---

## ⌨️ Quick Controls

| Key | Action |

That's it. That's all you need.

## 🎨 What the Orb Shows

- **Louder voice** → Larger expansion
- **Quieter voice** → Smaller expansion
- **High pitch** (like "sssss") → Tighter, rigid feel
- **Low pitch** (like "ooooo") → Softer, fluid feel
- **Silence** → Gentle breathing (intentional, not broken)

---

## 💡 Tips

### For Best Results:
- Speak at normal volume
- Use in a quiet room
- Try different voice timbres
- Watch during silence (it's alive!)

### The orb is NOT:
- A volume meter (it's slower)
- A beat detector (it's calmer)
- A visualizer (it's a presence)

## 🎯 Philosophy

AURA follows one principle:

**Silence has weight.**

Two people saying the same word produce different orbs.  
Silence feels intentional, not broken.  
Voice is not signal. Voice is memory.
