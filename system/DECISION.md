# DECISION — DR-X-V1

A one-shot decision protocol.
Use when stakes are non-trivial or ambiguity is blocking progress.

---

## 0) NAME THE DECISION
Decision:
- (Example: “Ship v1 with local-first only, or add cloud sync?”)

---

## 1) DEFINE THE OPERATOR
Who is deciding?
- …

Who is affected?

---

## 2) DEFINE THE OPTIONS (MAX 3)

- …
- …
- …
- …

---

## 4) DEFINE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLES)
Examples:
- Budget
- Time
- Privacy
- Legal
- Reversibility
- Human agency / exit paths

Constraints:
- …

---

## 5) RISK / REVERSIBILITY CHECK
For each option, answer:

Option A:
- Worst-case outcome:
- Is it reversible? (Y/N)
- Cost to reverse:
- Time to detect failure:

Option B:
- Worst-case outcome:
- Is it reversible? (Y/N)
- Cost to reverse:
- Time to detect failure:

Option C:
- Worst-case outcome:
- Is it reversible? (Y/N)
- Cost to reverse:
- Time to detect failure:

---

## 6) THE DR-X FILTER
For each option:
- Does it increase human agency? (Y/N)
- Does it reduce cognitive drag? (Y/N)
- Does it preserve ownership? (Y/N)
- Does it keep exit paths? (Y/N)

If any are “No,” mark the option as hostile unless explicitly justified.
