(CC-inspired, but custom and sovereign)

Copyright (c) 2026 Dr. X

This license governs the files, protocols, and textual artifacts in the repository

This is not Creative Commons.
This is a CC-inspired license with additional constraints designed to protect
human agency and prevent coercive uses.

## 1) GRANT OF RIGHTS

You are granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to:
- use, copy, and distribute the Work
- modify and create derivative works from the Work
- publish the Work or derivatives
- use the Work for commercial purposes

Subject to the conditions below.

---

## 2) ATTRIBUTION (MANDATORY)

If you share, publish, or distribute the Work (or a derivative), you must:
- credit: “inner-loop-os (Dr. X)”

## 3) SHARE-ALIKE FOR MANIFESTS (PHILOSOPHY LOCK)

If you modify any file that functions as the system’s bootloader or operating
philosophy (including but not limited to: `DR-X-MANIFEST.md`, `ETHOS.md`,
`DECISION.md`, `RETRO.md`), then:

- you must publish those modified files under this same license (DR-X-V3), and
- you must clearly label the modified version as “Modified” and include a
  change summary.

This clause applies to philosophy-bearing files only.
It does NOT force you to open-source your entire product or codebase.

---

## 4) DIVERGENCE RULE (PREVENT CONFUSION)

If your derivative materially diverges from the core principles of human agency,
reversibility, and non-coercion, you must do at least one of the following:
- rename the system (do not call it “inner-loop-os”), OR
- clearly mark your fork/template as “DIVERGENT” in the README and manifest

Material divergence includes (examples):
- removing exit paths
- adding coercive automation
- adding surveillance-first behavior
- introducing dark patterns

---

## 5) PROHIBITED USES (HARD NO)

You may NOT use the Work (or derivatives) to design, build, or facilitate:
- surveillance systems (including non-consensual monitoring, profiling, or tracking)
- coercive, manipulative, or non-consensual automation
- dark patterns intended to extract time, money, attention, or data
- systems that intentionally remove meaningful exit paths
- deceptive interfaces or concealed data collection

If a use case is ambiguous, interpret this section in favor of human agency.

You may not claim or suggest endorsement without explicit written permission.
