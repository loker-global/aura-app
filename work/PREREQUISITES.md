# AURA — Turn voice into a living fingerprint

⸻

## 0. DEFINITION

AURA is a macOS app that captures voice and transforms it into a living visual fingerprint.

Voice is not treated as sound alone, but as presence over time.

AURA records voice, renders it as a calm, embodied orb in real time or playback, and allows exporting that presence as audio or video — portable, replayable, and personal.

**Turn voice into a living fingerprint.**

⸻

## 1. CORE INTENT

AURA exists to answer one question:

**How does this voice exist in time?**

Not how loud it is.
Not how clean it is.
Not how impressive it is.

But how it moves, pauses, breathes, and settles.

⸻

## 2. NON-GOALS (HARD BOUNDARIES)

AURA is not:
- A DAW
- A podcast editor
- A music visualizer
- A voice changer
- A transcription tool
- A social network
- A cloud platform
- An AI personality generator

If a feature makes AURA louder, busier, or performative, it is rejected.

⸻

## 3. CORE CAPABILITIES (REQUIRED)

### A) Real-Time Presence
- Microphone input drives a single orb in real time
- Orb reacts with mass, inertia, and restraint
- Voice influences the orb; it does not puppeteer it
- Silence results in calm, intentional stillness

**Purpose:** To see voice as presence, not activity.

⸻

### B) Voice Recording (Source of Truth)
- Record voice to WAV (canonical format)
- Deterministic local storage
- USB microphones supported
- Partial files saved safely on interruption

**Purpose:** To preserve the true fingerprint.

⸻

### C) Playback = Fingerprint Replay
- Load WAV or MP3
- Orb replays the voice exactly as recorded
- Same mapping, same inertia, same silence

Playback is not visualization — it is re-embodiment.

**Purpose:** To let voice live again.

⸻

### D) Export (Portability)

**Export audio:**
- WAV (truth)
- MP3 (transport)

**Export video:**
- MP4 (orb + audio muxed)
- Clean framing, no UI
- Phone-ready (AirDrop / WhatsApp / iMessage)

**Purpose:** To carry voice beyond the app.

⸻

## 4. THE ORB (NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES)
- Single object
- Central presence
- Size mostly constant
- Motion driven by force, not volume
- Surface behaves like a tense membrane
- Deformation ≤ 3% of radius

**Forbidden:**
- Scrolling waveforms
- Beat syncing
- Jitter
- Particles
- Camera movement
- Visual noise

The orb must feel alive even in silence.

⸻

## 5. MOTION & PHYSICS CONTRACT
- Motion is slow (3× slower than literal audio)
- Changes integrate over time
- Inertia > responsiveness
- Silence has weight

**Rules of thumb:**
- Syllables → micro ripples
- Phrases → macro shifts
- Silence → stable authority

If someone can lip-read from the motion, it is too literal.

⸻

## 6. COLOR & MATERIAL LANGUAGE

**Orb colors:**
- Bone
- Warm gray
- Off-white

**Background:**
- Deep charcoal
- Near-black

**Lighting:**
- Soft rim
- Minimal specular
- No neon

Color communicates presence, not signal.

⸻

## 7. AUDIO PHILOSOPHY
- Original WAV is never modified
- Optional mild cleanup applies only to exports
- No aggressive denoising
- No voice alteration

If processing is audible, it is too strong.

⸻

## 8. PRIVACY & TRUST
- Local-first
- No accounts
- No cloud sync
- No analytics
- No telemetry

AURA treats voice as personal matter.

⸻

## 9. PLATFORM SCOPE
- macOS first (Apple Silicon + Intel)
- Keyboard-first
- Mouse optional

Future platforms may exist, but parity is not required.

⸻

## 10. SUCCESS CRITERIA

AURA is successful if:
- Two people saying the same words produce different orbs
- Silence feels intentional
- Muted video still feels complete
- Exports feel meaningful, not gimmicky
- Users trust AURA with their voice

⸻

## 11. FINAL PRINCIPLE

AURA does not visualize sound.

**AURA gives voice a body.**

⸻

**Status:** Approved foundation
