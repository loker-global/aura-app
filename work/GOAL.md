# GOAL

## Desired Outcome

Build AURA: a universal app for macOS and iOS that turns voice into a living visual fingerprint.

Voice recordings drive a calm, embodied orb in real time or playback. Export as audio or video. Local-first. No cloud. No accounts.

## Why This Matters

Voice is treated as signal or content, not presence. Existing tools show waveforms and levels — they lose rhythm, pauses, breath, timing, silence.

AURA gives voice a body that can be recorded, replayed, and shared.

## Success Criteria

- Two people saying the same words produce different orbs
- Silence feels intentional and calm
- Muted video still feels complete
- Exports feel meaningful, not gimmicky
- Users trust AURA with private voice moments
- Works on macOS and iOS (universal)

## Core Principles

- Tools over hype
- Precision
- Voice as memory
- Calm > Expressive
- Local-first
- Privacy absolute

## Done State

macOS app that:
- Records voice to WAV (canonical)
- Renders live orb presence in real time
- Replays recordings as orb re-embodiment
- Exports audio (WAV/MP3) and video (MP4 with orb)
- Provides virtual camera output for real-time orb streaming to other apps
- Feels complete, trustworthy, calm

**AURA does not visualize sound. AURA gives voice a body.**

**AURA supports both durable artifacts and live presence.**
