# API Wrapper — Example Project

A synthetic demo showing early-stage project definition.

---

## Scenario

Planning an API wrapper library. The project is in **DEFINING** state — goal is clear but implementation details are still being worked out.

---

## Files

- `GOAL.md` — The north star
- `STATUS.md` — Current state (DEFINING)

No PRD.md yet — that's the next step.

---

## How to Use This Example

1. Copy this directory to `work/`:
   ```bash
   cp -r examples/api-wrapper/* work/
   ```

2. Type `INIT` in your LLM session

3. The system will:
   - Read GOAL.md (wrap a REST API)
   - Read STATUS.md (currently DEFINING)
   - Notice PRD.md is missing
   - Propose creating PRD.md as next step

---

## What This Demonstrates

- Early-stage project with incomplete artifacts
- Protocol detecting missing files
- Logical progression: DEFINING → need PRD → then BUILDING

---

→ NEXT ACTION: Copy to work/ and run INIT to see how the protocol handles missing PRD.
