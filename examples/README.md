## How to Use

1. **Browse:** Read the files to understand the format
2. **Copy:** `cp -r examples/<name>/* work/`
3. **Activate:** Type `INIT` in your LLM session
4. **Observe:** Watch how the protocol interprets state and proposes next actions

---

## Creating Your Own

Start from templates:
```bash
cp templates/* work/
```

Or start fresh — the protocol will guide you through DISCOVERY MODE.

→ NEXT ACTION: Pick an example, copy to work/, and run INIT.
