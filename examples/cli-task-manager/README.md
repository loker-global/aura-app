# CLI Task Manager — Example Project

A synthetic demo showing inner-loop-os in action.

---

## Scenario

Building a simple CLI task manager in Python. The project is currently in **BUILDING** state — core functionality is being implemented.

---

## Files

- `GOAL.md` — The north star
- `STATUS.md` — Current state (BUILDING)
- `PRD.md` — What we're building
- `UX.md` — How it should feel

---

## How to Use This Example

1. Copy this directory to `work/`:
   ```bash
   cp -r examples/cli-task-manager/* work/
   ```

2. Type `INIT` in your LLM session

3. The system will:
   - Read GOAL.md (build a CLI task manager)
   - Read STATUS.md (currently BUILDING)
   - Read PRD.md (add, list, complete, delete tasks)
   - Propose the next implementation step

---

## What This Demonstrates

- File-based state tracking
- Mid-project resume (not starting from scratch)
- Clear scope boundaries (Non-Goals section)
- Concrete next steps

---

→ NEXT ACTION: Copy to work/ and run INIT to see the protocol in action.
