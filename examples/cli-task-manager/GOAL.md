# GOAL

## Desired Outcome
A working CLI task manager that runs locally, stores tasks in a plain text file, and requires zero configuration.

## Why This Matters
Existing task managers are bloated with features. I need something that works in 2 seconds from the terminal without accounts, syncing, or complex setup.

## Success Criteria
- Can add a task in under 3 seconds
- Can list all tasks with one command
- Can mark tasks complete
- Can delete tasks
- Data persists between sessions (file-based)
- Works offline, no network required
- Single file, no dependencies beyond Python stdlib
